Subdense : Suburban densification dashboard  
==================================================
   
Subdense dashboard is dedicated to the study of suburban densification through comparative analysis of six different cities during the past ten years. The cities are : Dortmund, Frankfurt, Strasbourg, Toulouse, Liverpool, Bristol. It is a proof of concept developed in collaboration between the partners of the ORA7 Subdense 2023-25 project. The different folders of the git organise collaborative production of answers to pending questions related to suburban densification.

Questions
-----------------------------------------------------
The study of suburban densification is driven by specific questions, like : where does densification happen, why are some parcels left unused, how do people perceive densification ? etc.

Answers
-----------------------------------------------------
The ultimate objective of the dashboard is to propose answers to the above questions based on state of the art science and data. 
To achieve them collaboration is needed for a deeper understanding of concepts, an identification of data potentially relevant, the selection of data, the production of comparable maps, the reading of maps and comparative analysis. Last but not least, answers will be shared in the form of narraties encompassing maps.  

Concepts
-----------------------------------------------------
Concepts are key for understanding, controversy and decision. Uncertainties and biases can be introduced by differences in concepts or in their representation. Some concepts, even though they belong to commonsense knowledge, also are still discussed like suburb and densification. Besides, there can exist different ways to represent a concept on maps.  

Maps, data, processes
-----------------------------------------------------
Maps dedicated to comparative analysis are produced collaboratively. To facilitate comparability, reproducible processes are adopted and clues to assist comparability and document biases are also produced along the way. 

Collaboration through git
------------------------------------------------------
Collaboration is supported by the git environment.

The folder Website contains the different files of the dashboard Website, including css, html. These pages can be either produced through ad hoc methods are generated automatically based on the dashboard ressources (in folders Concepts, Data, Maps and Processes). Questions and narratives are ultimately documented there as they are intended to be shared outside the project.

The folders Concepts, Data, Maps and Processes contain the different components of the dashboard that are key to the collaborative production of answers to questions :
- Concepts (e.g. : suburb, densification, city) : definitions, discussions around definitions, comparability of concepts across the studied cities, hints to which kind of data exist to observe the concept
- Data : description of data sources (aka data products, data series) relevant to the dashboard, description of specific datasets.
- Maps : visual display (image files) of maps that will compose the patchwork and associated description
- Processes : description of the processes that lead to the maps (extracting datasets from the sources, processing them, rendering) and that can be reproduced
These folders Concepts, Data, Maps and Processes follow the same structure : 
- CategoryOfThings.md (eg: Concepts.md, Datasets.md, Datasources.md, ...) : files that contain a register of CategoryOfThings used in the dashboard as well as a naming policy and description template for specific things belonging to this category (at the end of the file). The description of an item (eg: of the concept Suburb) can be either enclosed in the register or be detailed in a separate file in the same folder (see below).
- SpecificThing.md (eg: Densification.md) : description of a specific item 

The folder User stories contains descriptions of how users/contributors can engage with the dashboard. These users are partners of the ORA7 SUBDENSE project co funded by the german, british and french research agencies.
