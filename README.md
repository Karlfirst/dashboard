Subdense : Suburban densification dashboard  
==================================================   

This git is dedicated to open and collaborative design of maps to study and inform densification based on topographic building data over the past decades and on city region areas in France, UK and Germany. Unlike a traditional dashboard grounded on a core datawarehouse, this dashboard relies on different data sources that are kept separate. The git is used not to exchange data itslef but rather the different expertise and information attached to the process.

* Maps\StrasbourgStudy.md (and others to come): explicit expression of questions related to densification and building for a given spatial and temporal extent, links to studies Concepts and to maps (Maps.md) that can bring evidence to develop them
* Maps\Maps.md : description of some maps (scope, title, usage, files, focus views to be displayed on web site). A map is associated with a full resolution dataset ready to visualise on a GIS software (geopackage) for thorough reading. 
* Concepts.md : definitions, discussions around definitions, comparability of concepts across the studied cities, as well as how to put these concepts on maps through data
* Data : identification and description of data sources (aka data products, data series) relevant to the dashboard, a well as specific datasets produced during the studies process.
* Processes : description of useful processes for the maps design (extracting datasets from the sources, processing them, rendering) and associated tools.
