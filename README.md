# Subdense dashboard

The different folders contain the different components of the dashboard :
- Concepts (e.g. : suburb, densification, city) : definitions, discussions around definitions, comparability of concepts across the studied cities, hints to which kind of data exist to observe the concept
- Data : description of data sources (aka data products, data series) relevant to the dashboard, description of specific datasets.
- Maps : maps that will compose the patchwork and associated description
- Processes : description of the processes that lead to the maps (extracting datasets from the sources, processing them, rendering) and that can be reproduced
- User stories : description of how users/contributors can engage with the dashboard. These users are partners of the ORA7 SUBDENSE project co funded by the german, british and french research agencies.
- Web site draft : md files that are automatically processed to create the html pages of the Web site. 

Most folders follow the same structure : 
- CategoryOfThings.md (eg: Concepts.md, Datasets.md, Datasources.md, ...) : files that contain a register of CategoryOfThings used in the dashboard as well as a description template for specific things belonging to this category (at the end of the file). The description of an item (eg: of the concept Suburb) can be either enclosed in the register or be detailed in a separate file in the same folder (see below).
- SpecificThing.md (eg: Densification.md) : description of a specific item 
  
The wiki is a textual presentation of the project (redirecting readers to Subdense dashboard website).
