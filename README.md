Subdense : Suburban densification dashboard  
==================================================   

This dashboard is dedicated to the open and collaborative production and usage of maps to study and inform densification based on topographic building data over the past decades and on city region areas in France, UK and Germany. Unlike a traditional dashboard grounded on a core datawarehouse, this dashboard relies on different data sources that are kept separate. The very data are not exchanged through the platform but rather the expertise attached to the source, to the process and to the interpretation of maps.

Registers (eg: Concepts\Concepts.md, Data\Datasets.md, Data\Datasources.md, Maps\Maps.md, Maps\Studies.md, ...) are used to name unambiguously specific ressources useful throughout the dashboard process :

* Maps\Studies.md : explicit expression of questions related to densification and building for a given spatial and temporal extent (Studies.md), with links to studies Concepts and to maps (Maps.md) that can bring evidence to develop them
* Maps\Maps.md : description of maps (scope, title, usage, files, focus views to be displayed on web site). A map is associated with a full resolution dataset ready to visualise on a GIS software (geopackage) for thorough reading. This package is not exchanged through the git but rather through a research data platform whenever the licence of the source data allows it.
* Concepts (e.g. : suburb, densification, city) : definitions, discussions around definitions, comparability of concepts across the studied cities, hints to which kind of data exist to observe the concept
* Data : identification and description of specific datasets in particular research data designed to observe densification, identification and description of data sources (aka data products, data series) relevant to the dashboard.
* Processes : description of processes that lead to the maps (extracting datasets from the sources, processing them, rendering) and that can be reproduced. 

Last, a folder contains webpages produced through ad hoc methods are generated automatically based on the dashboard ressources (in folders Concepts, Data, Maps and Processes), to support Web access to the Dashboard knowledge and ressources.
