Subdense densification dashboard  
==================================================   

This is a proof of concept of an open and collaborative dashboard to observe and study densification through : 
- mapping building evolution in city region areas on the past decade in France, UK and Germany, based on automated spatial analysis tools and different vintages of topographic building data.
- identifying and specifying concepts that are needed to speak about densification, possibly inform controversy, based on a collaboration between persons with complementary perspectives on densification.
- comparing situations across cities and countries, based on reproducible methods and on the explicitation of information that could biase comparison (differences in data, differences in context).  

* Maps\StrasbourgStudy.md (and others to come): explicit expression of questions related to densification and building for a given spatial and temporal extent, links to studies Concepts and to maps (Maps.md) that can bring evidence to develop them
* Maps\Maps.md : description of some maps (scope, title, usage, files, focus views to be displayed on web site). A map is associated with a full resolution dataset ready to visualise on a GIS software (geopackage) for thorough reading. 
* Concepts.md : definitions, discussions around definitions, comparability of concepts across the studied cities, as well as how to put these concepts on maps through data
* Data : identification and description of data sources (aka data products, data series) relevant to the dashboard, a well as specific datasets produced during the studies process.
* Processes : description of useful processes for the maps design (extracting datasets from the sources, processing them, rendering) and associated tools.
