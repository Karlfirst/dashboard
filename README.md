# Subdense dashboard

Subdense dashboard is a prototype of information system dedicated to data-driven study of suburban densification across 6 cities in 3 european countries.
The different folders organise the different components :
- concepts (e.g. : suburb, densification, city) : definitions, discussions around definitions, comparability of concepts across the studied cities, hints to which kind of data exist to observe the concept
- data : description of data sources (aka data products, data series) relevant to the dashboard, description of specific datasets.
- maps : maps that will compose the patchwork and associated description
- processes : description of the processes that lead to the maps (extracting datasets from the sources, processing them, rendering) and that can be reproduced 
The wiki is a textual presentation of the project (redirecting readers to Subdense dashboard website).
