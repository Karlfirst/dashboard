Subdense : Suburban densification dashboard  
==================================================   

This dashboard is dedicated to the production and usage of maps to discuss on densification across different context, based on data and during the past decades. 
The core source is topographical data at different dates and on different cities.  
Our git project https://github.com/subdense/ supports collaboration for  specifying and producing comparable maps, documenting comparison biases -e.g. in 2020 smaller buildings were included in BDTopo(r) which were not included before-, reading and comparing maps. 

MAPS : start from Maps>Maps.md
CONCEPTS : start from Concepts>Concepts.md
   
In this git, registers (eg: Concepts\Concepts.md, Data\Datasets.md, Data\Datasources.md, Maps\Maps.md...) are used to name unambiguously specific ressources useful throughout the specification, production and revision of such maps : 
- Concepts (e.g. : suburb, densification, city) : definitions, discussions around definitions, comparability of concepts across the studied cities, hints to which kind of data exist to observe the concept
- Data :  identification and description of specific datasets in particular research data designed to observe densification, identification and description of data sources (aka data products, data series) relevant to the dashboard. In particular, user feedback (or comments) on dataset or on a datasource can be found in this folder, attached to the description of a specific dataset or datasource.
- Maps : identification and description of maps, as well as image files of the very map that can be visualised. Maps can be at a low resolution, for performance consideration, and available -either on a side platform or on request to the authors- at high resolution for deeper reading. In particular, user feedback (or comments) on dataset can be found in this folder, attached to the description of a specific dataset or datasource.
- Processes : identification and description of the processes that lead to the maps (extracting datasets from the sources, processing them, rendering) and that can be reproduced. Here also, user feedback (or comments) on dataset can be found in this folder, attached to the description of a specific dataset or datasource. 

The folder Website contains the different files of the dashboard Website, including css, html. These pages can be either produced through ad hoc methods are generated automatically based on the dashboard ressources (in folders Concepts, Data, Maps and Processes).
