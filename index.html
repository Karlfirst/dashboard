    <h1>Suburban densification dashboard</h1>
  <p>
  This dashboard patchwork is dedicated to the study of suburban densification across 6 european cities : Dortmund, Frankfurt, Strasbourg, Toulouse, Liverpool, Bristol Patchwork because we use different local data. It is currently under design during a collaborative projects.   
</p>
  <p>Trying to understand suburban densification, its drivers and impacts, specific QUESTIONS are needed. Where does densification happen? Why are some parcels left unused? How do people perceive densification ? etc. </p> 
  
  <p>Science-based CONCEPTS allow us to connect questions with required maps that will participate to our dashboard patchwork. </p>
    
  <p>Suburb : the concept of suburb ... There are local specificities : ..... </p>
      <p>Densification : </p>
      <p>Wasteland : </p> 
      <p>Polyrationalities : </p>
      <p>Sustainable habitat : </p>

  <p>At last, we produce SETS of MAPS and interpret them. </p>

  <p>Mapping buildings : city/year, comparisons. </p>
  <p>Mapping density through specific indicators :   </p>
  <p>Evolutions of buildings and of density : </p>
