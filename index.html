    <h1>Suburban densification dashboard</h1>
  <p>
  This dashboard is dedicated to the study of suburban densification across 6 european cities : Dortmund, Frankfurt, Strasbourg, Toulouse, Liverpool, Bristol. 
    </p>
  <p>To understand suburban densification, one must express QUESTIONS. Where does densification happen? Why are some parcels left unused? How do people perceive densification ? etc. </p> 
  
  <p>Science-based CONCEPTS allow us to connect questions with required maps. </p>
    
  <p>Suburb : the concept of suburb ... There are local specificities : ..... </p>
      <p>Densification : </p>
      <p>Wasteland : </p> 
      <p>Polyrationalities : </p>
      <p>Sustainable habitat : </p>

  <p>A next step is to produce MAPS:  buildings, density indicators, evolutions of buildings and of density, etc. </p>

  <p>Last, experts interpret maps and create NARRATIVES to share their findings. </p>
