    <h1>Subdense suburban densification dashboard</h1>
  <p>
  Subdense dashboard is dedicated to the study of suburban densification through comparative analysis of six different cities during the past ten years. The cities are : Dortmund, Frankfurt, Strasbourg, Toulouse, Liverpool, Bristol. It is a proof of concept developed in collaboration between the partners of the ORA7 Subdense 2023-25 project.

  <h3>Concepts</h3>
  <p>Concepts are importants. Some concepts, even though they belong to commonsense knowledge, also are still discussed like suburb and densification. Besides, there can exist different ways to represent a concept on maps. Uncertainties and biases can be introduced by differences in concepts or in their representation.</p> 

  <h3>Questions and narratives</h3>
  <p>The study of suburban densification is driven by specific questions, like : where does densification happen, why are some parcels left unused, how do people perceive densification ? etc. We try to answer the different questions related to suburban densification through maps. These answers are to be presented as narratives attached to sets of maps.</p>

<h3>Maps, data, processes</h3>
  <p>Maps are produced collaboratively with a purpose to facilitate comparability and document possible biases. To facilitate comparability, the production processes are shared. </p>
