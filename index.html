    <h1>Suburban densification dashboard</h1>
  <p>
  This proof of concept of a collaborative dashboard patchwork aiming at building comparable maps for the study of suburban densification across 6 european cities, at interpreting these maps to produce a deeper understanding of this phenomenon, its drivers and impacts. The collaboration is focused on : specifying the maps, producing them, interpreting them. Throughout the process, the management of possible biases and context specific consideration is key for the soudness of the comparative analysis.
</p>
  <p>QUESTIONS : trying to understand what is suburban densification, its drivers and impacts, more and more specific questions are needed to specify new maps. Questions such as : Where does densification happen? Why are some parcels left unused? How do people perceive densification ? etc. </p> 
  
  <p>CONCEPTS : science-based concepts and theory are useful for our comparative analysis.
