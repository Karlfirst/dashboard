<h1 id="concepts">Concepts</h1>
<p>List of concepts which are useful to study suburban densification and for which 1) it is relevant to go beyond commonsense knowledge and possibly to highlight elements to have in mind when comparing situations across times and cities 2) it is useful to specify how the concept can be observed through data.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definitions</strong>: Urban and suburban (Charmes &amp; Keil, 2015; Bibby et al., 2020). A definition in hypergeo, https://hypergeo.eu/suburb/?lang=en, much detailed for the french context</li>
<li><strong>Relation with data</strong> : the concept itself does not appear in geodata</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="densification">Densification</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definitions</strong> : “net increase of the number of housing units” within the pre-existing built-up area (Broitmanand Koomen, 2015). Authors distinguish Soft and hard densification (Ouati-Morel, 2015) as well as Planned and unplanned (Dunning et al., 2020)</li>
<li><strong>Relation with data</strong> : Urban density is described using 5 classes in urban atlas, grid data acquired on whole Europe at several time, nomenclatura (https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/urban_atlas_2012_2018_mapping_guide_v6.3 ). There exist lots of indicators to evaluate and rend density or densification. Refer to : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fUMyoBsP0JiG_2uW1zanIKPdACSpc1A4_i-8C__CBfI/edit#gid=0</li>

<h2 id="concept-labelling-and-description-template">Concept-labelling-and-description-template</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Label</strong> : whenever possible use the most adopted label and use the definitions section to express possible refinements.</li>
<li><strong>Definitions</strong> : explicit definitions, references to key papers, free text comments to explain possible distinctions across space or time that need to be considered during comparison.</li>
<li><strong>Relation with data</strong> : description of how the instances of the concept can be represented through geodata.</li>
</ul>
