<p>Processes are workflows aimed at being as reproducible as possible, shared among dashboard users.</p>
<p>The minimal elements that describe a process are <strong>input data</strong> and <strong>output data</strong>. Additional elements such as purpose or function, details to run it, implementation details, are useful to facilitate the sharing of processes.</p>

<ul>
<li>commit to this folder, either a <code>.md</code> file with an explicit name designing the process and containing a minimal description of the process, or a subfolder containing its description in a readme and additional files necessary to describe, reproduce, run, modify, etc. it.</li>
<li>in the description, include a detailed specification (files, types, data models, etc.) of the input and output data</li>
<li>describe the methid, with the successive steps necessary to reproduce it; this can be a textual description in terms of a fully manual process, or commands to run if scripts or executables are provided</li>
</ul>

<p><em>TBD: OpenMOLE script and embedding, or docker file</em></p>
<p>Issue of I/O generic specification: system (types? ontology?) allowing for an automatic checking of compatibilities and coupling of processes (additional layer to the OpenMOLE workflow validation system, taking into account complex types -&gt; use the scala compilator for this?)</p>
