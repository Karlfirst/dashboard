# Processes ConvertMdFilesToHtmlForTheWebsite
This process converts files in `.md` format to Html format. The idea is to automatically generate html files through a script and integrate it into the website.

## Usage
### Step 1: 
* Make sure pandoc is installed on your system
* Be sure to adjust the values of SOURCE_DIR and DEST_DIR depending on where your `.md` files are located and where you want the .html files to be saved.
### Step 2:
  Run the following command to make the script executable:

    chmod +x ConvertMdToHtml.sh
### Step 3:
  You can now run the script to convert all your `.md` files to `.html` using:
    
    ./ConvertMdToHtml.sh
