# Process : ProduceBuildingChangeCollection  

## Output 
- Output 1 : The BuildingChanges Collection composed of BuildingChanges (that can be at the level of individual entities, or urban blocks or neighbours) described through visuals, data and narratives, that can be presented on a ppt 
- Output 2 : BuildingChange Annotation Layers, on the different cities where the situations have been identified that contains zones and identifiers of the BuildingChanges in the collection, so that each situation can be localized more easily and explored within a GIS

## Generic Method : 
The method to produce the collection is iterative around several steps : Step1 -->  Step2 --> Step3 --> ( back to Step 1 or back to Step 2 )
-  Step 1 : identify specific BuildingChanges situation to integrate to the Collection
-  Step 2 : for each BuildingChange, prepare a first version of it, with available data and narratives that can be found online
-  Step 3 : organise interviews where the collection is presented in a specific order. These interviews and exchange lead to different results : acquisition of narratives / identification of new data or operations to improve the description of BuidingChange already in the collection,   is identified, identification of new  required situations (leading back to Step 1 or leading to the production of enriched BuildingChange datasets
