# Process: PrepareBuildingData 

This process consists in retrieving source data and preparing a dataset that contains all building data from the source on a given study area (usually functional urban area of a city) at a given timestamp. The main complexity consists in :
* identifying the modalities to retrieve data on the temporal scope of interest when going back in time
* identifying how to download data that correspond to the study area, how to assembly them if you download several data (and then be careful for duplicated items) and how to crop the study area.

The process is described more in details for specific data sources.
