Process : ComputeBuildingsEvolution 

Input Data :
*	A building dataset on a specific place at a specific year
*	A building dataset on the same place, same product, years after 

Output Data : 
*	A dataset corresponding to evolutions of buildings at the level of building entities on a given city, given products and different years, with the correct naming, and a description of this dataset, through a Subdense “Dataset” description so that others can know it exists and reuse it. 
*	A map of the above dataset with the correct naming, and a description of this dataset, through a Subdense “Dataset” description so that others can know it exists and reuse it.
*	A dataset corresponding to evolutions of relevant indicators to describe buildings evolution on a given city and different years, with the correct naming, and a description of this dataset, through a Subdense “Dataset” description so that others can know it exists and reuse it.
*	A map of the above dataset with the correct naming, and a description of this dataset, through a Subdense “Dataset” description so that others can know it exists and reuse it.

Method 1: Manual method
Results is at first very basic, and can be improved little by little through the identification of biases and quality checks.
Cannot be applied on large areas but only a smaller areas
Required expertise : QGIS
Details : 

Method 2: Semi-automated method
