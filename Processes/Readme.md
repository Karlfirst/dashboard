Processes are workflows aimed at being as reproducible as possible, shared among dashboard users.

## Adding processes to the dashboard

* register the process on the **Processes.md** registry by giving it an explicit and information name (use an informative name), 
* add a description, either within the register, or on a separate `.md` file with the same name as that in the registry and that contains a minimal description of the process, or a subfolder, with the same name as that in the registry, containing its description in a readme and additional files necessary to describe, reproduce, run, modify, etc. it.


## Automatising processes

*TBD: OpenMOLE script and embedding, or docker file*

Issue of I/O generic specification: system (types? ontology?) allowing for an automatic checking of compatibilities and coupling of processes (additional layer to the OpenMOLE workflow validation system, taking into account complex types -> use the scala compilator for this?)
