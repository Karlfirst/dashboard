# Process : ComputeBuildingEvolution 

## Input Data :
*	A building dataset on a specific city, at a specific year
*	A building dataset on the same city, same product, years after 

## Output Data : 
*	A dataset corresponding to evolutions of buildings data, with the schema depicted in this folder, with the correct file naming, and a description of this dataset, through a Subdense “Dataset” description so that others can know it exists and reuse it.

## Method : Automatic production of building evolution data
* //describe roughly how to use the script

## Refinement and Quality check 
Once building evolution features have been produced, some refinements can be applied.
