Subdense dashboard  

[sous-titre ] 
science based and data-driven study of densification in suburban areas of 6 european cities : . 

[parag in small letters ]  
This portal is a proof of concept of a collaborative dashboard patchwork aiming at building comparable maps for the study of suburban densification across 6 european cities, at interpreting these maps to produce a deeper understanding of this phenomenon, its drivers and impacts. The collaboration is focused on : specifying the maps, producing them, interpreting them. Throughout the process, the management of possible biases and context specific consideration is key for the soudness of the comparative analysis. 


[parag Questions-concepts]  
More and more specific questions are needed to understand, to specify new maps. Where does densification happen? Why are some parcels left unused? How do people perceive densification ? etc.
Social science bring some help to identify the kind of data that can be used to build maps to answer these questions. 
* suburb
* densification
* polyrationality 
* waste land
* soil sealing

Observing density and densification through buildings data : 
- Building and density data 
- Comparing building data between different cities, for the same year (link to a web page with maps, keys and interpretation) 
- Comparing building data for the same city, and different years (link to a web page with maps, keys and interpretation)
- Comparing density indicators ..

Subdense is developed by 4 research teams in Germany, France and UK, with expertise in geography, urban planning and geodata processing. It is funded by ORA 7th Call.
