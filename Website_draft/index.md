* Subdense : Suburband densification dashboard  
   
This is a prototype solution of science-based and data-driven study of suburban densification through comparative analysis of six different cities during the past ten years. The cities are : Dortmund, Frankfurt, Strasbourg, Toulouse, Liverpool, Bristol. 

Concepts are importants. Some concepts, even though they belong to commonsense knowledge, also are still discussed like suburb and densification. Besides, there can exist different ways to represent a concept on maps.  Uncertainties and biases can be introduced by differences in concepts or in their representation.

The study of suburban densification is driven by specific questions, like : where does densification happen, why are some parcels left unused, how do people perceive densification ? etc. We try to answer the different questions related to suburban densification through maps. These answers are to be presented as narratives attached to sets of maps. 

Maps are produced collaboratively with a purpose to facilitate comparability and document possible biases. To facilitate comparability, the production processes are shared.
