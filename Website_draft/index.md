[Title]
Suburban densification  

[sous-titre ] 
science based and data-driven study of densification in suburban areas of 6 european cities : . 


[parag What is this? ]  
This is a collaborative dashboard aiming at sharing questions and concepts related to suburban densification, at building comparable maps to answer them.


[parag Questions and concepts]  

What key questions need answers and what concepts can we use for that ?

[parag Maps] 

Different data can contribute to a comparative study of suburban densification, provided specific skills to process these data and interpret them. 

Observing density and densification through buildings data : 
- Building and density data 
- Comparing building data between different cities, for the same year (link to a web page with maps, keys and interpretation) 
- Comparing building data for the same city, and different years (link to a web page with maps, keys and interpretation)
- Comparing density indicators .. 

Understanding the context of densification through additional data :
