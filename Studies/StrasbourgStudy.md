# StrasbourgStudy

### Objective

1) To design maps about building evolutions within the functional urban area of Strasbourg that can be used by stakeholders with different expertise (citizens, scientists, ...) to discuss about densification, which is a concept more difficult to relate to observations than building.
2) To allow stakeholders to grasp the extent and nature of changes in the built environment, possibly to zoom in or zoom out and browse different maps some of which can be adapted only to expert groups.

   
#### Studied Concepts

Many concepts are transversal to the dashboard and are described in the Concepts.md section :  
**Building**, **Building Evolution**, **Built up area**

### Method 

Use individual building evolutions and derive different cartographic data out of these, including data at the scale of urban block, at the scale of the FUA. 
**Map_FR-STR-FUA-Evolution-2011-21**: map of raw building evolutions on the french part of the FUA of Strasbourg beteen 2011 and 2021

Characterize municipalities based on indicators that relate to building evolutions 

Derive correlation maps with population-related information.
