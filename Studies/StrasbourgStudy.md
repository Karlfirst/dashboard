# StrasbourgStudy

*This md file shall ultimately describe the specific study conducted on Strasbourg and provides references to related ressources on the dashboard.*

## Stakes, questions from Practitioners from Eurometropole 

* To identify words and maps that can support the identification of "densification potential", discussions on densification.
* To integrate in the analysis the different benefits brought by vacant plots to biodiversity. 
* To get inspiration from other cities, for example their strategies to develop elevation


## Approaches to bring evidences to support questions answering  

* (done, see data and maps below) : Changes of buildings entities and housing units systematically produced on the past decade, based on topographic building data from BDTopo in 2011 and 2021 in France, and from ATKIS data in the german part on the Functional Urban Area (see Concepts) of Strasbourg

* ( Brendan master project ) based on the building changes identify infill development, interview stakeholders interviews 

* (on going, Bénédicte + trainee + Brendan) Clarify concepts :  elevation and other concepts from the development sector, vacant plots, punlic spaces (incl indicators to caracterise their benefits wrt sustainable development) 
  
* (on going, Véra)  Integrate evolutions with other data to detect drivers
    

## Dataset and Maps 

*  Building changes (construction, demolition,  ...) between 2011 and 2021 on the functional urban area of Strasbourg
* 
*  Maps>Map_FR-STR-FUA-BuildingChange-2011-2021 : stylisation of BuildingChanges dataset, with different layers adapted to different levels of zoom : entities changes, clusters of changes, areal agregates (on 200x200 grid, on communes) 
*
