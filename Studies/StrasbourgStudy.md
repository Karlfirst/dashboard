# StrasbourgStudy

*This md file describes the specific study conducted on Strasbourg and provides references to related ressources on the dashboard.*

## Stakes, questions from stakeholders

* To identify words and maps that can support the identification of "densification potential", discussions on densification.
* To integrate in the analysis the different benefits brought by vacant plots to biodiversity. 
* To get inspiration from other cities, for example their strategies to develop elevation


## Maps/Data considered to bring evidences to answer the questions  
Different data could connect these questions to evidences : 
- Evolution of buildings entities and housing units systematically produced on the past decade, based on topographic building data from BDTopo in 2011 and 2021 + housing data, on the Functional Urban Area (see Concepts) of Strasbourg
- data from Strasbourg open data portal
- fichiers fonciers    

## Map production process 

### Map specification : Maps>Map_FR-STR-FUA-Evolution-2011-2021
* Building evolutions (appearance, disappearance, ...) between 2011 and 2021 on the functional urban area of Strasbourg, with different layers adapted to different levels of zoom : entities evolution, clusters of evolution, areal agregates (on 200x200 grid, on communes) 
* (on going) Housing units evolutions : not open data 
* (on going) population census evolution
* (tbd) vacant plot : reproduce DortmundStudy methodology
