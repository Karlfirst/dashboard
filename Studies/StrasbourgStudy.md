# StrasbourgStudy

*This md file shall compile existing work for the group own knowledge and to prepare material that we wish to present to stakeholders.*

## Stakes, questions from Practitioners from Eurometropole 

* Can we think of new words and maps to support the identification of "densification potential", discussions on densification.
* How to integrate in the analysis the different benefits brought by vacant plots (incl biodiversity). 
* Can we get inspiration from other cities, for example their strategies to develop elevation


## Approaches to bring evidences to support discussions  

* (done, see data and maps below) : Changes of buildings entities and housing units systematically produced on the past decade, based on topographic building data from BDTopo in 2011 and 2021 in France, and from ATKIS data in the german part on the Functional Urban Area (see Concepts) of Strasbourg

* ( Brendan master project ) based on the building changes identify infill development, interview stakeholders

* (Yibo internship) deepen the characterisation of building changes relevant to densification discussion, by 1) exploring, processing and annotating the BuildingChange data in a GIS environnemnt 2) designing a portfolio and using it during discussions with different experts (consortium + external incl. civil engineers, architectes) to trigger clarification of concepts, words and ambiguities. See all particularly if it is possible to integrate in the portfolio changes that refer to practitioners concerns. Detail the metholodogy in a process in this dashboard so that other can reproduce it, share the portfolio (in concepts folder) and the annotation layers (in data folder) with associated metadata.   
  
* (VÃ©ra)  Integrate evolutions with other data to detect drivers
    

## Dataset and Maps 

*  Building changes (construction, demolition,  ...) between 2011 and 2021, and between 2011 and 2022, on the functional urban area of Strasbourg, using BDTopo in french part, available as open data : https://doi.org/10.57745/RFKKYX

*  Maps>Map_FR-STR-FUA-BuildingChange-2011-2021 : stylisation of BuildingChanges dataset, with different layers adapted to different levels of zoom : entities changes, clusters of changes, areal agregates (on 200x200 grid, on communes), available as open data : https://doi.org/10.57745/RFKKYX
