# StrasbourgStudy

*This md file shall compile existing work for the group own knowledge and to prepare material that we wish to present to stakeholders.*

## Stakes, questions from Practitioners from Eurometropole 

* Can we think of new words and maps to support the identification of "densification potential", discussions on densification.
* How to integrate in the analysis the different benefits brought by vacant plots (incl biodiversity). 
* Can we get inspiration from other cities, for example their strategies to develop elevation


## Approaches to bring evidences to support questions answering  

* (done, see data and maps below) : Changes of buildings entities and housing units systematically produced on the past decade, based on topographic building data from BDTopo in 2011 and 2021 in France, and from ATKIS data in the german part on the Functional Urban Area (see Concepts) of Strasbourg

* ( Brendan master project ) based on the building changes identify infill development, interview stakeholders

* (tbd, Yibo) Clarify some densification concepts identified in the dashboard, starting with surelevation (see concepts.md) 
  ** analyse data : BuildingChange data (introduce and detect this new change); The database Demande d'autorisation d'urbanisme
  ** papers and interviews to clarify the concept with the view of experts
  ** propose a method to illustrate the concept on the dashboard with visuals and to support densification discussions using this concept.  
  
* (on going, VÃ©ra)  Integrate evolutions with other data to detect drivers
    

## Dataset and Maps 

*  Building changes (construction, demolition,  ...) between 2011 and 2021, and between 2011 and 2022, on the functional urban area of Strasbourg, using BDTopo in french part, available as open data : https://doi.org/10.57745/RFKKYX
