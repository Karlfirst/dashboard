# StrasbourgStudy

### Objective

1) To design maps about building evolutions within the functional urban area of Strasbourg that can be used by stakeholders with different expertise (citizens, scientists, ...) to observe and discuss about densification, possibly to zoom in or zoom out and browse different maps some of which can be adapted only to expert groups.
2) To refine the concept of "densification potential"
