# StrasbourgStudy

*This md file shall compile existing work for the group own knowledge and to prepare material that we wish to present to stakeholders.*

## Stakes, questions from Practitioners from Eurometropole 

* Can we think of new words and maps to support the identification of "densification potential", discussions on densification.
* How to integrate in the analysis the different benefits brought by vacant plots (incl biodiversity). 
* Can we get inspiration from other cities, for example their strategies to develop elevation


## Approaches to bring evidences to support questions answering  

* (done, see data and maps below) : Changes of buildings entities and housing units systematically produced on the past decade, based on topographic building data from BDTopo in 2011 and 2021 in France, and from ATKIS data in the german part on the Functional Urban Area (see Concepts) of Strasbourg

* ( Brendan master project ) based on the building changes identify infill development, interview stakeholders

* (tbd, Yibo) Clarify concepts that relate to specific actions to change buildings :  elevation and other concepts from the development sector, vacant plots, public spaces (incl indicators to caracterise their benefits wrt sustainable development), Mine the Demande d'autorisation d'urbanisme (reproduce APUR analysis), and prepare visuals simulating elevation to support discussions 
  
* (on going, VÃ©ra)  Integrate evolutions with other data to detect drivers
    

## Dataset and Maps 

*  Building changes (construction, demolition,  ...) between 2011 and 2021, and between 2011 and 2022, on the functional urban area of Strasbourg, using BDTopo in french part, available as open data : https://doi.org/10.57745/RFKKYX
