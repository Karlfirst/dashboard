Studies are explicit expression of questions for a given city of interest and specification of maps that can bring evidence to answer them. Maps are description of some maps with all information required for the map to be legible (scope, title, usage, files, focus views to be displayed on web site). A map is associated with a full resolution dataset ready to visualise on a GIS software (geopackage) for thorough reading, which is not available on the git but on a research data platform. Concepts are definitions, comparability of concepts across the studied countries, as well as how to put these concepts on maps through data. Data identify and describe data sources relevant to the dashboard, a well as specific datasets produced during the studies. Processes are descriptions of useful processes for the maps design (extracting datasets from the sources, processing them, rendering) and associated tools. </p> <p>This work is developed by the partners of the ORA7 Subdense 2023-25 project.
