# Concepts

List of concepts which are useful to study suburban densification and for which 1) it is relevant to go beyond commonsense knowledge and possibly to highlight elements to have in mind when comparing situations across times and cities 2) it is useful to specify how the concept can be observed through data. 

A concept is registered on this file and can also be described here, or a dedicated file can be created for describing and disucssing the concept., in which case the file shall be put in the same git folder as this registry Concepts.md, and it should be called by the concept label, e.g. Suburb.md.

## Suburb	
* **Definitions**: Urban and suburban (Charmes & Keil, 2015; Bibby et al., 2020). A definition in hypergeo, https://hypergeo.eu/suburb/?lang=en, much detailed for the french context 
* **Relation with data** : the concept itself does not appear in geodata 

## Densification
* **Definitions** : “net increase of the number of housing units” within the pre-existing built-up area (Broitmanand Koomen, 2015). Authors distinguish Soft and hard densification (Ouati-Morel, 2015) as well as Planned and unplanned (Dunning et al., 2020)
* **Relevant info to represent densification** : relevant information to study densification is : the building ages
* **Relation with data** :
  * * Urban density is described using 5 classes in urban atlas, grid data acquired on whole Europe at several time, nomenclatura (https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/urban_atlas_2012_2018_mapping_guide_v6.3 ).
  * * There exist lots of indicators to evaluate and rend density or densification. Refer to : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fUMyoBsP0JiG_2uW1zanIKPdACSpc1A4_i-8C__CBfI/edit#gid=0
  * * Buildings database can also be used to observe hard densification through the evolution of buildings entities as they can be observed 

## Concept-labelling-policy
* **Label** : whenever possible use the most adopted label and use the description to express possible refinements and associated expression if required. Avoid to create new concept labels.

## Concept-description-template
* **Definitions, incl. local specificities** : explicit definitions, references to key papers, free text comments to explain possible distinctions across space or time that need to be considered during comparison.
* **Relation with data** : description of how the instances of the concept can be mapped, with what kind of data (don't detail the specific data sources, this is to be done in the folder Data of this git).
