# Subdense densification dashboard  
___

This is a proof of concept of a collaborative dashboard to observe and study densification through:

- **detecting and mapping building changes in city region areas on the past decade** in France, UK and Germany, based on automated spatial analysis tools and different vintages of topographic building data.
- **clarifying and sharing concepts** that are needed to speak about densification, possibly inform controversy, based on a collaboration between persons with complementary perspectives on densification.
- **comparative studies across cities and countries**, based on reproducible methods and on the explicitation of information that could biase comparison (differences in data, differences in context).  

*This git does not contain data but rather*: the specification of the maps to be produced, the description of the production process and the analysis of the maps. Studies are explicit expression of questions for a given city of interest and specification of maps that can bring evidence to answer them. Maps are description of some maps with all information required for the map to be legible (scope, title, usage, files, focus views to be displayed on web site). A map is associated with a full resolution dataset ready to visualise on a GIS software (geopackage) for thorough reading, which is not available on the git but on a research data platform. Concepts are definitions, comparability of concepts across the studied countries, as well as how to put these concepts on maps through data. Data identify and describe data sources relevant to the dashboard, a well as specific datasets produced during the studies. Processes are descriptions of useful processes for the maps design (extracting datasets from the sources, processing them, rendering) and associated tools.
