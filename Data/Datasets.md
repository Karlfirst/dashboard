## DATASET-NAME
* Note : a dataset can be modified during the project and still keep same name, but the modifications will be documented in its provenance property.   
* **Provenance** : Textual description of how the datasets was acquired or produced, preferably referring to processes that are described on the dashboard.  This description can get enriched while the dataset is revised and improved (quality check and so on).
* **Usages** : References to datasets, maps, hypothesis (papers) that have been produced with this dataset
* **Feedback** : Comments related to the dataset, interpretation, identification of quality issues and so on

## BDTopo_BDG_STRSBG_2012	
* **Provenance**: application of GetData task to BDTopo, cropped with (tbd: specify here the contour that have been used) … 
* **Usages** : used to compute evolution with same data in 2022, and used to compute builtdensity indicator

## BDTopo_BDG_STRSBG_2022
