# Dataset BuildingEvolution_Strasbourg_2011_2021

**Provenance** : 
This data is the result of running the process ComputeBuildingEvolution on two building datasets from the datasource BDTOPO-FR, corresponding to 2011 and 2021, and on a specific study area.
The study area is defined as the administrative boundary of the city of Strasbourg in 2021. This boundary is obtained through downloading the theme Limites administratives of BDTOPO-FR, and the buildings are obtained through downloading the theme Batiments. 

**Usage** :

***Known Issues and Corrections*** :


***Suggestions for Future Improvements*** :

In response to the feedback received and to further improve our dataset, we are considering adding new attributes. This would include more detailed information on building usage, which would allow for a more comprehensive analysis of urban evolution. These enhancements aim to make the "BuildingEvolution" dataset richer and more suitable for a wider range of analytical applications and urban planning.
