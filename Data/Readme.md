# Metadata and pointers to data

This folder contains several files, currently word but to be transformed into md later for generation of the KG : 

- Datasources.docx : list of datasources, with a specific name to be used throughout the dashboard and specific metadata relevant to Subdense. The forst item is a template. 
- Datasets.docx : list of datasets, with a specific name to be used throughout the dashboard and specific metadata relevant to Subdense. The first item is a template. 



# Discussion

## Folder organisation

**Question: what should be the main organisation here? By data provider? data type? Data users?**

 - [JR (IGN) - 20230228] I started with data provider - we can add more hierarchical levels?
 - [BB(IGN)] Distinguish datasources and datasets at first and then we'll see

## Metadata and pointers

 - [JR (IGN) - 20230228] Do we try to uniformise data pointers and some metadata? In the spirit of the collaborative dashboard, this should be rather free - but it may cause problems for automatic processing.
 - [BB(IGN)] Let us adopt a common policy to name and identify stuffs, also provide templates for suggested metadata but let it be free text and then "knowledge graph" specialists will analyse and see how to generate more formal metadata
