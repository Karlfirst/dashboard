# Metadata and pointers to raw data


# Discussion

## Folder organisation

**Question: what should be the main organisation here? By data provider? data type? Data users?**

 - [JR (IGN) - 20230228] I started with data provider - we can add more hierarchical levels?

## Metadata and pointers

 - [JR (IGN) - 20230228] Do we try to uniformise data pointers and some metadata? In the spirit of the collaborative dashboard, this should be rather free - but it may cause problems for automatic processing.
