# Metadata and pointers to data


# Discussion

## Folder organisation

**Question: what should be the main organisation here? By data provider? data type? Data users?**

 - [JR (IGN) - 20230228] I started with data provider - we can add more hierarchical levels?
 - [BB(IGN)] Distinguish datasources and datasets at first and then we'll see

## Metadata and pointers

 - [JR (IGN) - 20230228] Do we try to uniformise data pointers and some metadata? In the spirit of the collaborative dashboard, this should be rather free - but it may cause problems for automatic processing.
 - [BB(IGN)] Let us adopt a common policy to name and identify stuffs, also provide templates for suggested metadata but let it be free text and then "knowledge graph" specialists will analyse and see how to generate more formal metadata
